## Overview
TweetByRSS is an automation tool designed to help users efficiently share updates from their favorite podcast RSS feeds directly to Twitter. Primarily built for podcast enthusiasts and creators, it bridges the gap between RSS feeds and Twitter, enabling efficient sharing of episodes or updates.

Users can input their desired podcast RSS feed URL and customize a tweet template according to their needs. Once configured, TweetByRSS provides a preview of the tweet content based on the selected podcast episode from the RSS feed.

## How to Use
1. **Select or Input the Podcast RSS Feed**: Upon launching the tool, you can select an existing channel from the drop-down menu, or input a new podcast RSS feed URL. TweetByRSS will fetch and display the podcast episodes from the RSS feed.

1. **Edit Tweet Template**: Once the podcast RSS feed is configured, you can create a tweet template. This template forms the basis of how the information fetched from the podcast RSS feed will be structured in the tweet. This might include details like the episode title, guest name(s), or key topics discussed.

1. **Select a Podcast Episode**: The fetched podcast episodes are displayed for your selection. Choose an episode from the list that you would like to share on Twitter.

1. **Preview and Tweet**: Once the episode is selected, a preview of the tweet, based on your tweet template, is generated. If the tweet looks as expected, you can choose to share it on Twitter directly from the tool.

Please note that TweetByRSS doesn't handle authorization with Twitter and as such, doesn't post tweets directly. It provides the formatted tweet text for you to copy and manually post on Twitter.
